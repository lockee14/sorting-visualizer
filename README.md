This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.2.

Generate an interactive visualization of sorting algorithms.

## Features

##### 1. Visualisations of the algorithms

- **Quick sort, an efficient sorting algorithm, this algorithm takes O(n log n) comparisons to sort n items. But in worst case scenario it take up to O(n²).
- **Merge sort, an other an efficient and general-purpose algorithm also take O(n log n) comparisons to sort n items.
- **Heap sort, an other an efficient and general-purpose algorithm also take O(n log n) comparisons to sort n items.
- **Buble sort, a simple algorithm but slow it take О(n²) comparisons to sort n items.

##### 2. How it work

Select an algorithm and then click on sort. You can also adjust the length of the array and the sorting speed as well as generate new array.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
